# Practical Session #1: Introduction

1. Find in news sources a general public article reporting the discovery of a software bug. Describe the bug. If possible, say whether the bug is local or global and describe the failure that manifested its presence. Explain the repercussions of the bug for clients/consumers and the company or entity behind the faulty program. Speculate whether, in your opinion, testing the right scenario would have helped to discover the fault.

2. Apache Commons projects are known for the quality of their code and development practices. They use dedicated issue tracking systems to discuss and follow the evolution of bugs and new features. The following link https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-794?filter=doneissues points to the issues considered as solved for the Apache Commons Collections project. Among those issues find one that corresponds to a bug that has been solved. Classify the bug as local or global. Explain the bug and the solution. Did the contributors of the project add new tests to ensure that the bug is detected if it reappears in the future?

3. Netflix is famous, among other things we love, for the popularization of *Chaos Engineering*, a fault-tolerance verification technique. The company has implemented protocols to test their entire system in production by simulating faults such as a server shutdown. During these experiments they evaluate the system's capabilities of delivering content under different conditions. The technique was described in [a paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1702/1702.05843.pdf) published in 2016. Read the paper and briefly explain what are the concrete experiments they perform, what are the requirements for these experiments, what are the variables they observe and what are the main results they obtained. Is Netflix the only company performing these experiments? Speculate how these experiments could be carried in other organizations in terms of the kind of experiment that could be performed and the system variables to observe during the experiments.

4. [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) has become the fourth official language supported by web browsers. The language was born from a joint effort of the major players in the Web. Its creators presented their design decisions and the formal specification in [a scientific paper](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/papers/Haas,%20Rossberg,%20Schuff,%20Titzer,%20Gohman,%20Wagner,%20Zakai,%20Bastien,%20Holman%20-%20Bringing%20the%20Web%20up%20to%20Speed%20with%20WebAssembly.pdf) published in 2018. The goal of the language is to be a low level, safe and portable compilation target for the Web and other embedding environments. The authors say that it is the first industrial strength language designed with formal semantics from the start. This evidences the feasibility of constructive approaches in this area. Read the paper and explain what are the main advantages of having a formal specification for WebAssembly. In your opinion, does this mean that WebAssembly implementations should not be tested? 

5.  Shortly after the appearance of WebAssembly another paper proposed a mechanized specification of the language using Isabelle. The paper can be consulted here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~caw77/papers/mechanising-and-verifying-the-webassembly-specification.pdf. This mechanized specification complements the first formalization attempt from the paper. According to the author of this second paper, what are the main advantages of the mechanized specification? Did it help improving the original formal specification of the language? What other artifacts were derived from this mechanized specification? How did the author verify the specification? Does this new specification removes the need for testing?

In October 2024, Mozilla has revealed that a critical security flaw impacting Firefox has come under active exploitation in the wild, known as [CVE-2024-9680](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2024-51/#CVE-2024-9680) . 

It's an use-after-free bug in the animation component, which is basically a local bug: dangling pointer that lead to undefined behavior. Attackers can exploited this to execute code in your browser if they can figure out how to insert malicious code to that pointer memory address. Mozilla had to immediately release a patch to fix it, but they have had reports of it being exploited in the wild. 

For the users afftected, we don't know that what happened to them as nothing catastrophic appeared, but it is possible that after code execution on their browser, personal data is compromised. For the company, it is certain that this is a hit to their userbase, because the market for browser is competitive right now.

In my opinion, it would be hard to detect this bug even with proper testing as pointer-related bug are always like that. The code still function normaly with dangling pointer, the only way to prevent this is to follow good coding pratice: set pointer to null after freeing it

[MultiSet.Entry::getCount() isn't 0 after removing the last element](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/COLLECTIONS/issues/COLLECTIONS-709?filter=doneissues)

This local bug is about number of entries in a MultiSet. Logically, after removing the last element from the set, its count should be 0, but somehow this is not the case here, when the set have only 1 element, entry.getCount() is 1, removing the last element and entry.getCount() is still 1. The fix is simply to manually set entry count to 0 after remove.

The contributor carefully added a test case that cover exactly the bug. 
```
  @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    public void testMultiSetEntrySetUpdatedToZero() {
        if (!isAddSupported()) {
            return;
        }
        final MultiSet<T> multiset = makeObject();
        multiset.add((T) "A");
        multiset.add((T) "A");
        final MultiSet.Entry<T> entry = multiset.entrySet().iterator().next();
        assertEquals(2, entry.getCount());
        multiset.remove((T) "A");
        assertEquals(1, entry.getCount());
        multiset.remove((T) "A");
        assertEquals(0, entry.getCount());
    }
```

### Advantages of Having a Formal Specification for WebAssembly

Ensures Consistency Across Implementations:
    A formal specification provides a precise, unambiguous definition of WebAssembly's behavior. This ensures all implementations, regardless of platform or browser, behave consistently.

Facilitates Correctness and Safety:
    By rigorously defining the semantics, the specification ensures that the language does not allow undefined behaviors. This is critical for safety in a system where code from untrusted sources executes.

Supports Soundness Proofs:
    The formal specification allows proving important properties, such as memory safety, type safety, and absence of undefined behavior, guaranteeing the integrity of WebAssembly programs.

Enhances Interoperability:
    A clear specification ensures that modules generated by different producers (compilers or tools) can work seamlessly together across implementations.

Simplifies Validation and Compilation:
    The formal definition allows WebAssembly code to be efficiently validated and compiled in a single linear pass, reducing runtime overhead.

Facilitates Tooling and Debugging:
    Developers can create tools (e.g., debuggers or interpreters) that conform to the specification without relying on trial and error, ensuring reliable behavior.

Encourages Clean Design:
    The use of formal methods during design leads to a clean, minimalistic architecture for WebAssembly, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Serves as a Foundation for Extensions:
    A solid, formally defined base simplifies the process of adding new features or extending WebAssembly in the future, as extensions can build on rigorously defined semantics.

### Should WebAssembly Implementations Still Be Tested?

WebAssembly implementations should still be thoroughly tested. While a formal specification provides a strong foundation, it does not eliminate the need for testing. Because: 

Real-World Complexities:
    Implementations involve numerous practical considerations, like optimizing performance on different hardware, interacting with other web technologies, or dealing with non-standard user inputs. Testing ensures these complexities are handled correctly.

Implementation Bugs:
    Developers might misinterpret parts of the specification or introduce coding errors during implementation. Testing helps uncover such issues.

Integration with Host Environments:
    WebAssembly often interacts with JavaScript and Web APIs. Testing ensures seamless integration and identifies issues arising from interactions between components.

Performance Validation:
    Tests can measure and optimize performance, which is critical for meeting the low-overhead execution goals of WebAssembly.

Security Assurance:
    While formal specifications help mitigate security risks, practical testing (e.g., fuzzing or penetration testing) is essential to identify and fix vulnerabilities.

### Advantages of the Mechanized Specification

#### Increased Rigor and Automation:
The mechanized specification provides a formal, machine-verified model of WebAssembly using Isabelle, which ensures correctness without relying on manual verification.
It guarantees properties such as type soundness through fully mechanized proofs, which is more reliable than pen-and-paper methods.

#### Detection and Resolution of Errors:
The process of mechanization uncovered several deficiencies in the original specification. For example, issues with the propagation of the Trap operation and the semantics of the Return operation were identified and corrected, improving the overall quality of the specification.

#### Executable Artifacts:
The mechanized model produced a verified interpreter and a type checker for WebAssembly, providing tools that align with the specification while being formally verified for correctness.

####Â Support for Extensions:
By abstracting certain aspects of the implementation (e.g., host environment behavior), the mechanized specification provides a flexible foundation for incorporating future features of WebAssembly.

### Impact on the Original Formal Specification

The mechanized specification significantly improved the original formal specification by identifying and correcting critical errors. These fixes ensured soundness properties such as type safety and progress. Additionally, the collaboration between the mechanization author and the WebAssembly working group helped refine the languageâ€™s specification.

### Artifacts Derived from the Mechanized Specification

    Verified Interpreter: A sound implementation of WebAssembly execution semantics, proven correct against the mechanized model.
    Executable Type Checker: A verified type-checking algorithm that aligns with the specification and ensures efficient, single-pass validation.
    Differential Testing Tools: These were used to validate the mechanized interpreter against industry implementations and to find inconsistencies or bugs in the WebAssembly ecosystem.

### Verification of the Specification

The mechanized specification was validated through:

Proofs: Formal proofs of soundness properties (progress and preservation) using Isabelle.
Conformance Tests: Validation against the official WebAssembly conformance test suite, ensuring alignment with the expected behavior.
Fuzzing: Differential testing using tools like CSmith to generate WebAssembly programs and compare results against commercial engines.

### Does This Remove the Need for Testing?

The mechanized specification does not eliminate the need for testing. While mechanized proofs ensure correctness for the modeled aspects of the language, real-world implementations involve practical challenges such as:

Integration with non-modeled components (e.g., host environments, parsers, and linkers).
Performance optimizations that may introduce errors.
Handling of unforeseen edge cases in production.
